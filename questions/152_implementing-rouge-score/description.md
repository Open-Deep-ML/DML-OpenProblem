## Problem

Implement the ROUGE-1 (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score to evaluate the quality of a generated summary by comparing it to a reference summary. ROUGE-1 focuses on unigram (single word) overlaps between the candidate and reference texts.

Your task is to write a function that computes the ROUGE-1 recall, precision, and F1 score based on the number of overlapping unigrams.
