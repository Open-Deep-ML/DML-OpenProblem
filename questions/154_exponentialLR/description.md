## Problem

Write a Python class ExponentialLRScheduler to implement a learning rate scheduler based on the ExponentialLR strategy. Your class should have an __init__ method to initialize with an initial_lr (float) and gamma (float) parameter. It should also have a get_lr(self, epoch) method that returns the current learning rate for a given epoch (int). The learning rate should be decreased by gamma every epoch. The returned learning rate should be rounded to 4 decimal places. Only use standard Python.
