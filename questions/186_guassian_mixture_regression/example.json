  "reasoning": "A Gaussian Process with a linear kernel is trained on perfectly linear data that follows the function y = 2x + 1. When asked to predict the value at x=3, the model perfectly interpolates the linear function it has learned, resulting in a prediction of 2*3 + 1 = 7. The near-zero noise ensures the prediction is exact."
