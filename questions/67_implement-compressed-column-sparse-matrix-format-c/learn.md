## Understanding the Compressed Column Sparse Matrix Format

The Compressed Column Sparse (CSC) format is a memory-efficient representation of sparse matrices, where most elements are zero. This format is especially useful in scientific computing, numerical simulations, and optimization problems where matrix operations often focus on columns.

### Concepts

A sparse matrix is one that contains a large number of zero elements. Storing such matrices in a standard two-dimensional format wastes memory and computation time. The CSC format solves this by storing only the non-zero elements and their positions.
In the CSC format, a matrix is represented by three one-dimensional arrays:

1. **Values array**: Contains all the non-zero elements of the matrix, stored column by column.
2. **Row indices array**: Stores the row index corresponding to each value in the values array.
3. **Column pointer array**: Stores the cumulative number of non-zero elements in each column, allowing quick access to each column's data. It points to the position within the row indices array where the column starts.

### Structure

Given a matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
0 & 2 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The CSC representation would be:

1. **Values array**: \[1, 2, 3, 4]
2. **Row indices array**: \[1, 2, 0, 1]
3. **Column pointer array**: \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

### Explanation:

1. The **values array** contains the non-zero elements in column-major order.
2. The **row indices array** stores the corresponding row index for each non-zero element.
3. The **column pointer array** indicates where each column starts in the values array. For example, column 0 starts at index 0, column 1 starts at index 1, column 2 starts at index 2, and so on.

### Applications

The CSC format is widely used in:

1. **Solving sparse linear systems** (especially in column-oriented algorithms)
2. **Optimization problems** where column operations dominate
3. **Graph algorithms** where adjacency matrices are processed by columns
4. **Sparse matrix factorizations** (e.g., LU decomposition)

The CSC format improves memory usage and computational efficiency by storing only the necessary non-zero elements and enabling fast access to column data.
