Write a Python function that calculates the determinant of a 4x4 matrix using Laplace's Expansion method. The function should take a single argument, a 4x4 matrix represented as a list of lists, and return the determinant of the matrix. The elements of the matrix can be integers or floating-point numbers. Implement the function recursively to handle the computation of determinants for the 3x3 minor matrices.
