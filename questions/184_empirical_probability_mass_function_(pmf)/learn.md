# Probability Mass Function (PMF) — Simple Explanation

A **probability mass function (PMF)** describes how probabilities are assigned to the possible outcomes of a **discrete random variable**.

- It tells you the chance of each specific outcome.  
- Each probability is non-negative.  
- The total of all probabilities adds up to 1.

## Estimating from data
If the true probabilities are unknown, you can estimate them with an **empirical PMF**:
- Count how often each outcome appears.  
- Divide by the total number of observations.  

## Example
Observed sequence: `1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3` (6 outcomes total)
- “1” appears once → estimated probability = 1/6  
- “2” appears twice → estimated probability = 2/6 = 1/3  
- “3” appears three times → estimated probability = 3/6 = 1/2
