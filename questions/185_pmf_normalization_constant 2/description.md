## Problem

A discrete random variable `X` takes values 0 through 7 with probabilities:

- P(X=0) = 0
- P(X=1) = K
- P(X=2) = 2K
- P(X=3) = 2K
- P(X=4) = 3K
- P(X=5) = K^2
- P(X=6) = 2K^2
- P(X=7) = 7K^2 + K

Find the value of the normalization constant `K` such that the above defines a valid PMF (i.e., probabilities are nonâ€‘negative and sum to 1).

Implement a function `find_k()` that returns `K` as a Python float.
