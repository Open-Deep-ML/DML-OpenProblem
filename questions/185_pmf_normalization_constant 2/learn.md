## Solution Explanation

For a valid PMF, probabilities must sum to 1.

Sum all terms:

- Linear in K: K + 2K + 2K + 3K + K = 9K
- Quadratic in K: K^2 + 2K^2 + 7K^2 = 10K^2

Therefore: 10K^2 + 9K = 1  =>  10K^2 + 9K - 1 = 0

Solve the quadratic: K = [-9 ± sqrt(81 + 40)] / 20 = [-9 ± 11] / 20

Feasible solution (K ≥ 0): K = 2/20 = 0.1

So the normalization constant is K = 0.1.
