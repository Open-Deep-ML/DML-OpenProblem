  "reasoning": "The function extracts each patch from the input image based on the kernel size and stride, then flattens each patch into a 1D vector. Each row of the output corresponds to one local patch. For example, the kernel is 2x2, so the first window covers [2,4,9,2], then shifts across the image horizontally and vertically until all patches are collected."
