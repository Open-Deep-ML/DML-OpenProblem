Implement the gradient bandit algorithm for action selection in a multi-armed bandit setting. Write a class GradientBandit that maintains a set of action preferences and updates them after each reward. The class should provide a method `select_action()` to sample an action using the softmax of preferences, and a method `update(action, reward)` to update preferences using the gradient ascent update rule. Use only NumPy.
