Write a Python function `leaky_relu` that implements the Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky ReLU) activation function. The function should take a float `z` as input and an optional float `alpha`, with a default value of 0.01, as the slope for negative inputs. The function should return the value after applying the Leaky ReLU function.
