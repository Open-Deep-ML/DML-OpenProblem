## Problem

Write a Python function `accumulate_gradients` that takes a list of numpy arrays (each representing gradients from a mini-batch) and returns a single numpy array representing the sum of all gradients. All input arrays will have the same shape. Only use standard Python and numpy. The returned array should be of type float and have the same shape as the input arrays.
