# **Gradient Accumulation**

## **1. Definition**
Gradient accumulation is a technique used in machine learning to simulate larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients over multiple mini-batches before performing an optimizer step. Instead of updating the model parameters after every mini-batch, gradients are summed (accumulated) over several mini-batches, and the update is performed only after a specified number of accumulations.

## **2. Why Use Gradient Accumulation?**
* **Simulate Large Batch Training:** Allows training with an effective batch size larger than what fits in memory by splitting it into smaller mini-batches.
* **Stabilize Training:** Larger effective batch sizes can lead to more stable gradient estimates and smoother convergence.
* **Hardware Constraints:** Useful when GPU/TPU memory is limited and cannot accommodate large batches directly.

## **3. Gradient Accumulation Mechanism**
Given a list of gradient arrays $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_N$ (from $N$ mini-batches), the accumulated gradient $G$ is computed as:

$$
G = \sum_{i=1}^N g_i
$$

Where:
* $g_i$: The gradient array from the $i$-th mini-batch (numpy array)
* $N$: The number of mini-batches to accumulate
* $G$: The accumulated gradient (numpy array of the same shape)

**Example:**
If $g_1 = [1, 2]$, $g_2 = [3, 4]$, $g_3 = [5, 6]$:
* $G = [1+3+5, 2+4+6] = [9, 12]$

## **4. Applications of Gradient Accumulation**
Gradient accumulation is widely used in training:
* **Large Models:** When training large models that require large batch sizes for stability or convergence.
* **Distributed Training:** To synchronize gradients across multiple devices or nodes.
* **Memory-Constrained Environments:** When hardware cannot fit the desired batch size in memory.
* **Any optimization problem** where effective batch size needs to be increased without increasing memory usage.

Gradient accumulation is a simple yet powerful tool to enable flexible and efficient training in modern machine learning workflows.
