## Solution Explanation

The key insight is to use numpy's vectorized operations to efficiently calculate distances between the query point and all data points simultaneously, then select the k smallest distances.

## Algorithm Steps:

Convert to numpy arrays - Transform the input tuples into numpy arrays for vectorized operations
Calculate distances - Use broadcasting to compute Euclidean distance from query point to all points at once
Find k nearest - Use np.argsort() to get indices of points sorted by distance, then take first k
Return as tuples - Convert the selected points back to tuple format
