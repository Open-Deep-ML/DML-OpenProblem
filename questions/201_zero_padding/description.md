In image processing, padding is important because it helps preserve spatial dimensions during convolution operations, prevents information loss at image borders, and enables consistent output sizes across layers in deep learning models. Write a function `pad_matrix` that will return a zero-padded version of the input matrix. The original matrix will be called `a` and the amount of padding will be controlled by another integer parameter called `padding`. Note that the input matrix may not necessarily be square.
