<h2>Understanding Normal Distribution</h2>
The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution widely used in statistics. It describes data that clusters around a mean or average, with fewer values farther from the mean.

<h3>Mathematical Formulation</h3>
The probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \) for a given value \( x \) is given by:

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right)
\]

<h3>Implementation Steps</h3>

1. **Define Parameters**: Set the mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \) of the distribution.
2. **Apply PDF Formula**: For a specified \( x \), plug in the values of \( \mu \), \( \sigma \), and \( x \) into the PDF formula.
3. **Calculate Probability Density**: Compute the result, which gives the probability density of \( x \).

<h3>Example Calculation</h3>
Given:

- **Mean** \( \mu \) = 0
- **Standard Deviation** \( \sigma \) = 1
- **Value** \( x \) = 1

The probability density at \( x = 1 \) is calculated as:

\[
f(1) = \frac{1}{1 \times \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(1 - 0)^2}{2 \times 1^2}\right) \approx 0.24197
\]

<h3>Applications</h3>
The normal distribution is essential in various fields, including:

- **Statistics**: Many statistical tests assume normal distribution.
- **Machine Learning**: Assists in modeling and understanding data distributions.
- **Natural and Social Sciences**: Often used to model measurement errors, natural events, and human characteristics.

This problem asks you to calculate the probability density for a given \( x \)-value in a normal distribution, using specified mean and standard deviation values.
