<h2>Understanding TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</h2>
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic used to reflect the importance of a word in a document within a collection or corpus. It is commonly used in information retrieval and text mining.
<h3>Mathematical Formulation</h3>
TF-IDF is the product of two statistics: Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).

Term Frequency (TF):
[
TF(t,d) = \frac{\text{Number of times term } t \text{ appears in document } d}{\text{Total number of terms in document } d}
]
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):
[
IDF(t) = \log\left(\frac{\text{Total number of documents}}{\text{Number of documents containing term } t}\right)
]
TF-IDF:
[
TFIDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) \times IDF(t)
]

Note: For this problem, we use
Smooth - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):
[
Smooth_IDF(t) = \log\left(\frac{\text{Total number of documents} + 1}{\text{Number of documents containing term } t + 1}\right) + 1
]
The constant “1” is added to the numerator and denominator of the idf as if an extra document was seen containing every term in the collection exactly once, which prevents zero divisions.

<h3>Implementation Steps</h3>

Compute TF: For each term in each document, calculate its term frequency.
Compute IDF: Calculate the inverse document frequency for each unique term in the corpus.
Calculate TF-IDF: Multiply TF and IDF for each term in each document.
Normalize: (Optional) Normalize the TF-IDF vectors for each document.

<h3>Example Calculation</h3>
Given:

Corpus: 3 documents

Doc1: "The cat sat on the mat"
Doc2: "The dog chased the cat"
Doc3: "The bird flew over the mat"



Compute TF-IDF for the word "cat" in Doc1:

TF("cat", Doc1):
[
TF("cat", Doc1) = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667
]
IDF("cat"):
[
IDF("cat") = \log\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.1761
]
TF-IDF("cat", Doc1):
[
TFIDF("cat", Doc1) = 0.1667 \times 0.1761 \approx 0.0293
]

<h3>Applications</h3>
TF-IDF is widely used in:

Information Retrieval
Text Mining
Document Classification
Search Engines
Recommendation Systems

This statistic helps in ranking a document's relevance given a user query, document summarization, and feature extraction for machine learning algorithms in natural language processing.
