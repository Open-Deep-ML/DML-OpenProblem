<h2>Understanding Orthogonal Projection in Vector Spaces</h2>
<p>
  Orthogonal projection is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, used to
  project one vector onto another. The projection of vector
  <strong>v</strong> onto a line defined by vector <strong>L</strong> results in
  a new vector that lies on <strong>L</strong>, representing the closest point
  to <strong>v</strong> on that line. This can be thought of
  <strong>v</strong>'s shadow on <strong>L</strong> if a light was shown
  directly down on <strong>v</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To project a vector <strong>v</strong> onto a non-zero vector
  <strong>L</strong> in space, we calculate the scalar projection of
  <strong>v</strong> onto the unit vector of <strong>L</strong>, which
  represents the magnitude of the projection. The resulting projection vector
  lies along the direction of <strong>L</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  For any vector <strong>v</strong> in Cartesian space, the orthogonal
  projection onto <strong>L</strong>
  is calculated using the formula:
</p>
<p>\[ \text{proj}_{L} (v) = \frac{v \cdot L}{L \cdot L} L \]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>v</strong> is the vector being projected,</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> is the vector defining the line of projection,</li>
  <li>
    \( v \cdot L \) is the dot product of <strong>v</strong> and
    <strong>L</strong>,
  </li>
  <li>
    \( L \cdot L \) is the dot product of <strong>L</strong> with itself, which
    gives the magnitude squared of <strong>L</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The resulting projection vector lies along the direction of
  <strong>L</strong> and represents the component of <strong>v</strong> that is
  parallel to <strong>L</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  More generally, the projection of <strong>v</strong> onto a unit vector \(
  \hat{L} \) (the normalized version of <strong>L</strong>) simplifies to:
</p>
<p>\[ \text{proj}_{L} (v) = (v \cdot \hat{L}) \hat{L} \]</p>

<h3>Applications of Orthogonal Projection</h3>
<p>
  Orthogonal projection has a wide range of applications across various fields
  in mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering. Some of the most
  common applications include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Computer Graphics:</strong> In 3D rendering, orthogonal projections
    are used to create 2D views of 3D objects. This projection helps in reducing
    dimensional complexity and displaying models from different angles.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Science and Machine Learning:</strong> In high-dimensional
    data, projection methods are used to reduce dimensions (e.g., Principal
    Component Analysis) by projecting data onto lower-dimensional subspaces,
    helping with data visualization and reducing computational complexity.

</ul>
