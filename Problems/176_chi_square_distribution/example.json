    "reasoning": "To calculate the probability density for x in a chi-square distribution with k degrees of freedom, we use the formula:\n\nf(x; k) = (1 / (2^(k/2) * Gamma(k/2))) * x^((k/2) - 1) * exp(-x/2)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nf(2; 2) = (1 / (2^1 * Gamma(1))) * 2^(1 - 1) * exp(-2/2)\n= (1 / (2 * 1)) * 1 * exp(-1)\n= 0.5 * 0.3679 â‰ˆ 0.184\n\nSo, the probability density at x = 2 for k = 2 is approximately 0.184."
