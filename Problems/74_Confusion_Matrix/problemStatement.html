<h2>Generate Confusion Matrix</h2>

<p>Write a Python function that generates the confusion matrix for a list of results of a binary classification task</p>

<p>Each observation has two values: the actual label and the predicted label</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Input: [[1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0], [0, 1]]</li>
    <li>Output: [[1, 1], [2, 1]]   </li>
    <li>Reasoning:
        <ul>
            <li>There is one observation of class 1 that was labeled as class 1 ([1,1]), so there is 1 true positive</li>
            <li>There is one observation of class 1 that was labeled as class 0 ([1,1]), so there is 1 false negative</li>
            <li>There are two observations of class 0 that were labeled as class 1 ([0,1]), so there are 2 false positives</li>
            <li>There is one observation of class 0 that was labeled as class 0 ([0,0]), so there is 1 true negative</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
