<h2>Generate Confusion Matrix</h2>

<p>The confusion matrix is a very useful tool to get a better understanding of the performance of a classification model. In it, you can visualize how many data points were labeled according to their correct categories.</p>

<p>For a binary classification problem of a dataset with \(n\) observations, the confusion matrix is a \(2 \times 2\) matrix with the following structure:</p>

\[
M = \begin{pmatrix} 
TP & FN \\
FP & TN
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Where:

<ul>
    <li>TP: True positives, the number of observations from the positive label that were correctly labeled as positive</li>
    <li>FN: False negatives, the number of observations from the positive label that were incorrectly labeled as negative    </li>
    <li>FP: False positives, the number of observations from the negative label that were incorrectly labeled as positive    </li>
    <li>TN: True negatives, the number of observations from the negative label that were correctly labeled as negative    </li>
</ul>

A confusion matrix is a great starting point for computing more advanced metrics such as precision and recall that capture the model's performance.
