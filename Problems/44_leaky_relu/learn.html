<h2>Understanding the Leaky ReLU Activation Function</h2>

<p>The Leaky ReLU (Leaky Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is a variant of the ReLU function used in neural networks. It addresses the "dying ReLU" problem by allowing a small, non-zero gradient when the input is negative. This small slope for negative inputs helps keep the function active and helps prevent neurons from becoming inactive.</p>

<h3>Mathematical Definition</h3>

<p>The Leaky ReLU function is mathematically defined as:</p>

\[
f(z) = \begin{cases} 
z & \text{if } z > 0 \\
\alpha z & \text{if } z \leq 0 
\end{cases}
\]

<p>Where \(z\) is the input to the function and \(\alpha\) is a small positive constant, typically \(\alpha = 0.01\).</p>

<p>In this definition, the function returns \(z\) for positive values, and for negative values, it returns \(\alpha z\), allowing a small gradient to pass through.</p>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Output Range:</strong> The output is in the range \((- \infty, \infty)\). Positive values are retained, while negative values are scaled by the factor \(\alpha\), allowing them to be slightly negative.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> The function has a similar "L" shaped curve as ReLU, but with a small negative slope on the left side for negative \(z\), creating a small gradient for negative inputs.</li>
    <li><strong>Gradient:</strong> The gradient is 1 for positive values of \(z\) and \(\alpha\) for non-positive values. This allows the function to remain active even for negative inputs, unlike ReLU, where the gradient is zero for negative inputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>This function is particularly useful in deep learning models as it mitigates the issue of "dead neurons" in ReLU by ensuring that neurons can still propagate a gradient even when the input is negative, helping to improve learning dynamics in the network.</p>
