<h2>Hyperdimensional Computing</h2>
<p>
  Hyperdimensional Computing, HDC, is a computational model inspired by the
  brain's ability to represent and process information using high-dimensional
  vectors, based on hypervectors being quasi-orthogonal. It uses vectors with a
  large number of dimensions to represent data, where each vector is typically
  filled with binary, 1 or 0, or bipolar values, 1 or -1. To represent complex
  data pattern, binding and bundling operations are used. In HDC, different data
  types such as numeric and categorical variables are projected into
  high-dimensional space through specific encoding processes. Categorical
  variables are assigned unique hypervectors, often randomly generated binary or
  bipolar vectors, that serve as representations for each category. Numeric
  variables, are encoded by discretising the continuous values, and mapping
  discrete bins to hypervectors. These projections allow HDC models to integrate
  various data types into a unified high-dimensional representation, preserving
  information across complex, multi-feature datasets.

<h4>Binding Operation</h4>
<p>
  The binding operation between two hypervectors is performed element-wise using
  multiplication. This operation is used to represent associations between
  different pieces of information:
</p>
\[ \text{bind}(\text{hv1}, \text{hv2}) = \text{hv1} \times \text{hv2} \]
<p>
  Where \( \text{hv1} \) and \( \text{hv2} \) are bipolar vectors, and their
  element-wise multiplication results in a new vector where each element is
  either 1 or -1.
</p>
<h4>Bundling Operation</h4>
<p>
  The bundling operation sums multiple hypervectors to combine information,
  typically using element-wise addition for bipolar vectors and XOR operations
  for binary vectors. This operation aggregates information and creates a
  composite hypervector that represents the overall data or concept. For
  example, for a set of \( n \) hypervectors \( \text{hv1}, \text{hv2}, \dots,
  \text{hvn} \), the bundled vector is:
</p>
\[ \text{bundle}(\text{hv1}, \text{hv2}, \dots, \text{hvn}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}
\text{hvi} \]
<p>This bundled vector is then normalized to ensure it remains bipolar.</p>
<h4>Normalization</h4>
<p>
  Normalization ensures that the final bundled vector contains only bipolar or
  binary values. The normalization function typically applies a thresholding
  process that transforms any value greater than zero to +1 and any value less
  than zero to -1. Zero values are then typically assigned to either +1 or -1.
</p>
<h3>Operations in Practice: Example</h3>
<p>
  Consider a scenario where we want to represent and combine information from
  each feature in a row of a dataset. Each feature, whether numeric or
  categorical, is represented by a hypervector, and these hypervectors are
  combined to form a composite vector that represents the entire row of data.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, if we have a dataset row with features <em>Feature A</em> and
  <em>Feature B</em>, we would:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Create a hypervector for the column <em>Feature A</em> and another for its
    specific feature value.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a hypervector for the column <em>Feature B</em> and another for its
    specific feature value.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bind each featureâ€™s column hypervector with the hypervector representing its
    value to form a unique vector for each feature.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bundle all the feature hypervectors for this row to create a single
    composite vector representing the entire row.
  </li>
  <li>Normalize the bundled vector to maintain bipolar values.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Applications of HDC</h3>
