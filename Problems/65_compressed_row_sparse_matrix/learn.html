<h2>Understanding the Compressed Row Sparse Matrix Format</h2>

The Compressed Row Sparse, CSR, format is a data-efficient representation of
sparse matrices, where most of the elements are zero. This format is
particularly useful in large-scale scientific computing and machine learning
applications, where memory efficiency is critical.

<h3>Concepts</h3>

A sparse matrix is a matrix that contains a large number of zero elements.
Storing such matrices in their full form can be inefficient, both in terms of
memory and computational resources. The CSR format addresses this problem by
storing only the non-zero elements and their positions in the matrix. In the CSR
format, a matrix is represented by three one-dimensional arrays:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Values array</strong>: Contains all the non-zero elements of the
    matrix, stored row by row.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Column indices array</strong>: Stores the column index corresponding
    to each value in the values array.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Row pointer array</strong>: Stores the cumulative number of non-zero
    elements in each row, allowing quick access to each row's data. This means
    that it points to the position within the column indices array at which the
    row starts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure</h3>

Given a matrix: \[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 3 & 0 & 4 &
0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 5 \end{bmatrix} \] The CSR representation would be:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Values array</strong>: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5]</li>
  <li><strong>Column indices array</strong>: [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3]</li>
  <li><strong>Row pointer array</strong>: [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]</li>
</ul>

<h4>Explanation:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <strong>values array</strong> holds the non-zero elements in the matrix,
    in row-major order.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>column indices array</strong> stores the corresponding column
    index of each non-zero element.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>row pointer array</strong> keeps track of where each row starts
    in the values array. For example, row 1 starts at index 0, row 2 starts at
    index 1, row 3 starts at index 2, within the columns indices array, and so
    on.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Applications</h3>

The CSR format is widely used in high-performance computing applications such
as:
<ul>
  <li>Finite element analysis (FEA)</li>
  <li>Solving large sparse linear systems (e.g., in numerical simulations)</li>
  <li>
    Machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines with sparse
    input)
  </li>
  <li>Graph-based algorithms where adjacency matrices are often sparse</li>
</ul>

The CSR format improves both memory efficiency and the speed of matrix
operations by focusing only on non-zero elements.
