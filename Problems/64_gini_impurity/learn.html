<h2>Understanding Gini Impurity</h2>

Gini impurity is a statistical measurement of the impurity or disorder in a list
of elements. It is commonly used in decision tree algorithms to decide the
optimal split at tree nodes. It is calculated as follows, where p<sub>i</sub> is
the probability of each class - n<sub>i</sub>/n: \[ \text{Gini Impurity} = 1 -
\sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i^2 \] A gini impurity of 0 indicates a node where all element
are the same class, whereas, a gini impurity of 1-1/C indicates a maximum
impurity, where elements are evenly distributed among each class. This means
that a lower impurity implies a less homogenous distribution of elements,
suggesting a good split, as decision tress aim to minimise it at each node.

<h3>Advantages and Limitations</h3>

Advantages:
<ul>
  <li>Computationally efficient</li>
  <li>Works for binary and multi-class classification</li>
</ul>

Limitations:

<ul>
  <li>Biased to larger classes</li>
  <li>May cause overfitting in big decision trees</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Calculation</h3>

Suppose we have the set: [0,1,1,1,0] The probability of the classes are
calculated as follows: \[ p_{0} = 2/5 \quad p_{1} = 3/5 \] The Gini Impurity is
then calculated as follows: \[ \text{Gini Impurity} = 1 - (p_0^2 + p_1^2) = 1 -
((2/5)^2 + (3/5)^2) = 0.48\]
