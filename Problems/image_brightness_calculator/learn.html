<h2>Image Brightness Calculator</h2>

Consider a grayscale image represented as a 2D matrix where each element represents a pixel value between 0 (black) and 255 (white):

\[
Image = \begin{pmatrix}
p_{11} & p_{12} \\
p_{21} & p_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

The average brightness is calculated as:
\[
Brightness = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} p_{ij}}{m \times n}
\]

where:
- \(p_{ij}\) is the pixel value at position (i,j)
- \(m\) is the number of rows
- \(n\) is the number of columns

Things to note:
- All pixel values must be between 0 and 255
- The image matrix must be well-formed (all rows same length)
- Empty or invalid images return -1
