<h2>Understanding Gaussian Elimination</h2>

Gaussian Elimination is used to replace matrix coefficients with a row-echlon
form matrix, that can be more easily solved via backwards substitution.

<!-- <ul>
  <li>All non-zero rows are above any rows of all zeros</li>
  <li>
    The leading entry of each non-zero row is to the right of the leading entry
    of the previous row.
  </li>
  <li>
    The leading entry in any non-zero row is 1, and all entries below it in the
    same column are zeros.
  </li>
</ul> -->

<!-- <h3>Augmented Matrix</h3>

For a linear system Ax = b, an augmented matrix is a way of diplaying all the
numerical information in a linear system, in a single matrix. This combines the
coefficient matrix (A) and vector source (b) as such: \[ \begin{pmatrix} a₁₁ &
a₂₁ & a₃₁ & b₁\\ a₁₂ & a₂₂ & a₃₂ & b₂\\ a₃₁ & a₃₂ & a₃₃ & b₃ \end{pmatrix} \]

<h3>Partial Pivoting</h3>

In linear algebra, diagonal elements of a matrix are referred to as the "pivot".
To solve a linear system, the diagonal is used as a divisor to other elements
within the matrix. This means that Gaussin Elimination will fail if there is a
zero pivot.

<br />
<br />
In this case, pivoting is used to interchange rows, to ensure a non-zero pivot.

<br />
<br />
More specifically, partial pivoting looks at all other rows in the current
column to find the row with highest absulute value. This row is then
interchanged with the current row. This not only increases the numerical
stability of the solution, but also reduces round-off errors caused by dividing
by small entries. -->

<h3>Gaussian Elimination Mathematical Formulation</h3>

Gaussian Elimination:

<ul>
  <li>
    For <span class="math">k = 1</span> to
    <span class="math">number of rows - 1</span>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>apply partial pivoting to the current row.</li>
      <li>
        For <span class="math">i = k + 1</span> to
        <span class="math">number of rows</span>
        <ul class="indent">
          <li>
            <span class="math"
              >m<sub>ik</sub> = a<sub>ik</sub> / a<sub>kk</sub></span
            >
          </li>

          <li>
            For <span class="math">j = k</span> to
            <span class="math">number of columns</span>
            <ul class="indent">
              <li>
                <span class="math"
                  >a<sub>ij</sub> = a<sub>ij</sub> - m<sub>ik</sub> * a<sub
                    >kj</sub
                  ></span
                >
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="math"
              >b<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>i</sub> - m<sub>ik</sub> * b<sub
                >k</sub
              ></span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Backwards Subtitution:

<ul>
  <li>
    For <span class="math">k = number of rows</span> to
    <span class="math">1</span>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>
        For <span class="math">i = number of columns - 1</span> to
        <span class="math">1</span>
        <ul class="indent">
          <li>
            <span class="math"
              >b<sub>k</sub> = b<sub>k</sub> - a<sub>ki</sub> * b<sub
                >i</sub
              ></span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="math">b<sub>k</sub> = b<sub>k</sub> / a<sub>kk</sub></span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example Calculation</h4>

\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 8 & 4\\ 5 & 5 & 1 \\ 4 & 10 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \quad
\text{and} \quad b = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \] Apply partial
pivoting to increase the magnitude of the pivot. For A<sub>11</sub> calculate
the factor for the elimination of A<sub>12</sub>: m<sub>12</sub> = A<sub
  >12</sub
>
/ A<sub>11</sub> = 2 / 5 = 0.4 <br />
<br />
Apply this scaling to row 1 and minus this from row 2, eliminating
A<sub>12</sub>: \[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 5 & 1 \\ 0 & 6 & 3.6 \\ 4 & 10 & -1
\end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \\ 1
\end{pmatrix} \] After the full Gaussian Elimination process has been applied to
A and b, we get the following: \[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 5 & 1\\ 0 & 6 & 3.6 \\
0 & 0 & -5.4 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \\
3 \end{pmatrix} \] To calculate x we can apply backward substitution, by
substituting in the currently solved values and dividing by the pivot. This
would give the following for the first iteration: x<sub>3</sub> = b<sub>3</sub>
/ A<sub>33</sub> = 3 / -5.4 = -0.56 <br />
<br />
This can be repeated iteratively for all rows to solve the linear system,
substituting in the solved values for the rows below.

<h3>Applications</h3>

Gaussian Elimination and linear solvers as a whole have a wide range of
real-world application. Most prevelant are there application in
machine-learning, computational fluid dynamics and 3d graphics.
