<h2>Understanding the Compressed Row Sparse Matrix Format</h2>

The Compressed Row Sparse, CSC, format is a data-efficient representation of
sparse matrices, where most of the elements are zero. This format is
particularly useful in large-scale scientific computing and machine learning
applications, where memory efficiency is critical.

<h3>Concepts</h3>

A sparse matrix is a matrix that contains a large number of zero elements.
Storing such matrices in their full form can be inefficient, both in terms of
memory and computational resources. The CSC format addresses this problem by
storing only the non-zero elements and their positions in the matrix. In the CSC
format, a matrix is represented by three one-dimensional arrays:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Values array</strong>: Contains all the non-zero elements of the
    matrix, stored row by row.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Column indices array</strong>: Stores the column index corresponding
    to each value in the values array.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Row pointer array</strong>: Stores the cumulative number of non-zero
    elements in each row, allowing quick access to each row's data.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure</h3>

Given a matrix: \[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 3 & 0 & 4 &
0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 5 \end{bmatrix} \] The CSC representation would be:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Values array</strong>: [1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5]</li>
  <li><strong>Row indices array</strong>: [0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]</li>
  <li><strong>Column pointer array</strong>: [0, 3, 4, 6, 7]</li>
</ul>
<h4>Explanation:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <strong>values array</strong> holds the non-zero elements in the matrix,
    in column-major order.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>row indices array</strong> stores the corresponding row index of
    each non-zero element.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>column pointer array</strong> keeps track of where each column
    starts in the values array. For example, column 1 starts at index 0, column
    2 starts at index 3, column 3 starts at index 4, and so on.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Applications</h3>

The CSC format is widely used in high-performance computing applications such
as:
<ul>
  <li>Finite element analysis (FEA)</li>
  <li>Solving large sparse linear systems (e.g., in numerical simulations)</li>
  <li>
    Machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines with sparse
    input)
  </li>
  <li>Graph-based algorithms where adjacency matrices are often sparse</li>
</ul>

The CSC format improves both memory efficiency and the speed of matrix
operations by focusing only on non-zero elements.
