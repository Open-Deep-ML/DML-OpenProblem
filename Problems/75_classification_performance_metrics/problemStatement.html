<h2>Generate Performance Metrics</h2>

<p>Given the actual and predicted labels of the observations of a binary classification problem, return the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of the model</p>

<p>The input consists of two lists: one for the actual values and one for the predicted values</p>

<p>Round the performance metrics to 3 decimals</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Input: 
        <ul>
            <li>Actual labels: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]</li>
            <li>Predicted labels: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Output: [[4, 5], [4, 2]], 0.4, 0.5, 0.444, 0.471   </li>
    <li>Reasoning:
        <ul>
            <li>There are four observations of class 1 that are labeled as class 1, so there are 4 true positives</li>
            <li>There are five observations of class 1 that are labeled as class 0, so there are 5 false negatives</li>
            <li>There are four observations of class 0 that are labeled as class 1, so there are 4 false positives</li>
            <li>There are two observations of class 0 that are labeled as class 0, so there are 2 true negatives</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>With that information we can calculate all of the performance metrics</li>
</ul>
