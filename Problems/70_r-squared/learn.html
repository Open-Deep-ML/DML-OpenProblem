<h2>Understanding R-squared (R²) in Regression Analysis</h2>
<p>R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. It provides insight into how well the model fits the data.</p>

<h3>Mathematical Definition</h3>
<p>The R-squared value is calculated using the following formula:</p>
\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SSR}}{\text{SST}} \]
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SSR \((\)Sum of Squared Residuals\()\):</strong> The sum of the squares of the differences between the actual values and the predicted values.</li>
    <li><strong>SST \((\)Total Sum of Squares\()\):</strong> The sum of the squares of the differences between the actual values and the mean of the actual values.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equations for SSR and SST</h3>
<p>To calculate SSR and SST, we use the following formulas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>SSR: \[ \text{SSR} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]</li>
    <li>SST: \[ \text{SST} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2 \]</li>
</ul>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( y_i \): Actual value</li>
    <li>\( \hat{y}_i \): Predicted value</li>
    <li>\( \bar{y} \): Mean of the actual values</li>
</ul>

<h3>Significance of R-squared</h3>
<p>R-squared is a key metric for evaluating how well a regression model performs. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit for the model, meaning it can explain more variability in the data. However, it’s important to note that a high R-squared does not always imply that the model is good; it can sometimes be misleading if overfitting occurs. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other metrics for comprehensive model evaluation.</p>

<h3>Implementing R-squared Calculation</h3>
<p>In this problem, you will implement a function to calculate R-squared given arrays of true and predicted values from a regression task. The results should be rounded to three decimal places.</p>
<p>In the solution, the implemented <code>r_squared()</code> function calculates R-squared by first determining SSR and SST, then applying them to compute R². It handles edge cases such as perfect predictions and situations where all true values are identical.</p>
