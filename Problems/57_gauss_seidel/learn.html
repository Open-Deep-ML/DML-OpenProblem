<h2>Understanding the Gauss-Seidel Method</h2>

The Gauss-Seidel method is a technique for solving linear systems of equations
(Ax = b). As opposed to fixed-point Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel uses previously
computed results, as soon as they are available. This increases convergence,
resulting in fewer iterations. However, this means that it is not as easily
parallelisable as fixed-point Jacobi.

<h3>Mathematical Formulation</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>Initialization</b>: Start with an initial guess for \(x\).</li>
  <li>
    <b>Iteration</b>: For each equation \(i\), update \(x[i]\) using: \[
    x_{i}^{(k+1)} = \frac{1}{a_{ii}} \left( b[i] - \sum_{j < i} a_{ij}
    x_{j}^{(k+1)} - \sum_{j > i} a_{ij} x_{j}^{(k)} \right)\] where \(a_{ii}\)
    are the diagonal elements of \(A\), and \(a_{ij}\) are the off-diagonal
    elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Convergence</b>: Repeat the iteration until the changes in \(x\) are
    below a certain tolerance or until a maximum number of iterations is
    reached.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Matrix Form</h3>
Gauss-Seidel can also be expressed in matrix form, in terms of the matrix
diagonal (D), lower triangle (L) and upper triangle (U): \[ x_{i}^{(k)} = D^{-1}
\left( b - Lx^{(k+1)} - Ux^{(k)} \right) \]

<h3>Example Calculation</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s solve the system of equations:</p>
\[ 3x_1 + x_2 = 5 \quad x_1 + 2x_2 = 5 \]

<ol>
  <li>Initialize \( x_1^{(0)} = 0 \) and \( x_2^{(0)} = 0 \).</li>

  <li>First iteration:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>For \( x_1^{(1)} \):</li>
    \[ x_1^{(1)} = \frac{1}{3} \left( 5 - 1 \cdot x_2^{(0)} \right) =
    \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667 \]

    <li>For \( x_2^{(1)} \):</li>
    \[ x_2^{(1)} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 5 - 1 \cdot x_1^{(1)} \right) =
    \frac{1}{2} \left( 5 - 1.6667 \right) \approx 1.6667 \]
  </ol>

  <li>
    After the first iteration, the values are \( x_1^{(1)} = 1.6667 \) and \(
    x_2^{(1)} = 1.6667 \).
  </li>

  <li>Continue iterating until the results converge to a desired tolerance.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Applications</h3>

Gauss-Seidel and other iterative linear solvers are commonly used in data
science, computational fluid dynamics and 3d-graphics.
