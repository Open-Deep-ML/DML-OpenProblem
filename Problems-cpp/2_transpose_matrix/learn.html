<h2>Transpose of a Matrix</h2>

Consider a matrix \(M\) and its transpose \(M^T\), where:

Original Matrix \(M\):
\[
M = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & b & c \\ 
d & e & f 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Transposed Matrix \(M^T\):
\[
M^T = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & d \\ 
b & e \\ 
c & f 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Transposing a matrix involves converting its rows into columns and vice versa. This operation is fundamental in linear algebra for various computations and transformations.
