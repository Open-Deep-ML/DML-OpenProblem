<h2>Reshaping a Matrix</h2>

Matrix reshaping involves changing the shape of a matrix without altering its data. This is essential in many machine learning tasks where the input data needs to be formatted in a specific way.

For example, consider a matrix \(M\):

Original Matrix \(M\):
\[
M = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 
5 & 6 & 7 & 8 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Reshaped Matrix \(M'\) with shape (4, 2):
\[
M' = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 \\ 
3 & 4 \\ 
5 & 6 \\ 
7 & 8 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Ensure the total number of elements remains constant during reshaping.
