<h2>Scalar Multiplication of a Matrix</h2>

When a matrix \(A\) is multiplied by a scalar \(k\), the operation is defined as multiplying each element of \(A\) by \(k\). 

Given a matrix \(A\):
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11} & a_{12} \\ 
a_{21} & a_{22} 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

And a scalar \(k\), the result of the scalar multiplication \(kA\) is:
\[
kA = \begin{pmatrix} 
ka_{11} & ka_{12} \\ 
ka_{21} & ka_{22} 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This operation scales the matrix by \(k\) without changing its dimension or the relative proportion of its elements.
