  "description": "\n## Task: Image Brightness Calculator\n\nIn this task, you will implement a function `calculate_brightness(img)` that calculates the average brightness of a grayscale image. The image is represented as a 2D matrix, where each element represents a pixel value between 0 (black) and 255 (white).\n\n### **Your Task**:\nImplement the function `calculate_brightness(img)` to:\n1. Return the average brightness of the image rounded to two decimal places.\n2. Handle edge cases:\n   - If the image matrix is empty.\n   - If the rows in the matrix have inconsistent lengths.\n   - If any pixel values are outside the valid range (0-255).\n\nFor any of these edge cases, the function should return `-1`.",
