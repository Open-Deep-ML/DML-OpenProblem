  "learn_section": "## Overview\nLogistic regression is a model used for a binary classification poblem.\n\n## Prerequisites for a regular logistic regression\nLogistic regression is based on the concept of \"logits of odds\". **Odds** is measure of how frequent we encounter success. It also allows us to shift our probabilities domain of $[0, 1]$ to $[0,\\infty]$ Consider a probability of scoring a goal $p=0.8$, then our $odds=\\frac{0.8}{0.2}=4$. This means that every $4$ matches we could be expecting a goal followed by a miss. So the higher the odds, the more consistent is our streak of goals. **Logit** is an inverse of the standard logistic function, i.e. sigmoid: $logit(p)=\\sigma^{-1}(p)=ln\\frac{p}{1-p}$. In our case $p$ is a probability, therefore we call $\\frac{p}{1-p}$ the \"odds\". The logit allows us to further expand our domain from $[0,\\infty]$ to $[-\\infty,\\infty]$.\n\nWith this domain expansion we can treat our problem as a linear regression and try to approximate our logit function: $X\\beta=logit(p)$. However what we really want for this approximation is to yield predictions for probabilities:\n$$\nX\\beta=ln\\frac{p}{1-p} \\\\\ne^{-X\\beta}=\\frac{1-p}{p} \\\\ \ne^{-X\\beta}+1 = \\frac{1}{p} \\\\\np = \\frac{1}{e^{-X\\beta}+1}\n$$\n\nWhat we practically just did is taking an inverse of a logit function w.r.t. our approximation and go back to sigmoid. This is also the backbone of the regular logistic regression, which is commonly defined as:\n$$\n\\pi=\\frac{e^{\\alpha+X\\beta}}{1+e^{\\alpha+X\\beta}}=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\alpha+X\\beta)}}.\n$$\n\n## Loss in logistic regression\nThe loss function used for solving the logistic regression for $\\beta$ is derived from MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation). This method allows us to search for $\\beta$ that maximize our **likelihood function** $L(\\beta)$. This function tells us how likely it is that $X$ has come from the distribution generated by $\\beta$: $L(\\beta)=L(\\beta|X)=P(X|\\beta)=\\prod_{\\{x\\in X\\}}f^{univar}_X(x;\\beta)$, where $f$ is a PMF and $univar$ means univariate, i.e. applied to a single variable.\n\nIn the case of a regular logistic regression we expect our output to belong to a single Bernoulli-distributed random variable (hence the univariance), since our true label is either $y_i=0$ or $y_i=1$. The Bernoulli's PMF is defined as $P(Y=y)=p^y(1-p)^{(1-y)}$, where $y\\in\\{0, 1\\}$. Also let's denote $\\{x\\in X\\}$ simply as $X$ and refer to a single pair of vectors from the training set as $(x_i, y_i)$. Thus, our likelihood function would look like this:\n$$\n\\prod_X p\\left(x_i\\right)^{y_i} \\times\\left[1-p\\left(x_i\\right)\\right]^{1-y_i}\n$$\n\nThen we convert our function from likelihood to log-likelihood by taking $ln$ (or $log$) of it:\n$$\n\\sum_X y_i \\log \\left[p\\left(x_i\\right)\\right]+\\left(1-y_i\\right) \\log \\left[1-p\\left(x_i\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nAnd then we replace $p(x_i)$ with the sigmoid from previously defined equality to get a final version of our **loss function**:\n$$\n\\sum_X y_i \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x_i\\beta}}\\right)+\\left(1-y_i\\right)\\log \\left(1-\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x_i\\beta}}\\right)\n$$\n\n## Optimization objective\nRecall that originally we wanted to search for $\\beta$ that maximize the likelihood function. Since $log$ is a monotonic transformation, our maximization objective does not change and we can confindently say that now we can equally search for $\\beta$ that maximize our log-likelihood. Hence we can finally write our actual objective as:\n\n$$\nargmax_\\beta [\\sum_X y_i \\log\\sigma(x_i\\beta)+\\left(1-y_i\\right)\\log (1-\\sigma(x_i\\beta))] = \\\\\n= argmin_\\beta -[\\sum_X y_i \\log\\sigma(x_i\\beta)+\\left(1-y_i\\right)\\log (1-\\sigma(x_i\\beta))]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid. This function we're trying to minimize is also called **Binary Cross Entropy** loss function (BCE). To find the minimum we would need to take the gradient of this LLF (Log-Likelihood Function), or find a vector of derivatives with respect to every individual $\\beta_j$.\n\n### Step 1\nTo do that we're going to use a chain rule, that describes relational change in variables that our original function is made of. In our case the log-likeligood function depends on sigmoid $\\sigma$, $\\sigma$ depends on $X\\beta$ and $X\\beta$ finally depends on $\\beta_j$, hence:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial LLF}{\\partial\\beta_j}=\\frac{\\partial LLF}{\\partial\\sigma}\\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial[X\\beta]}\\frac{\\partial[X\\beta]}{\\beta_j}\\\\\n=-\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y^{(i)} \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)}-(1-y^{(i)} ) \\frac{1}{1-\\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)}\\right) \\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial[x^{(i)}\\beta]}\n$$\n\n### Step 2\nThen we use a derivative of the sigmoid function, that is $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma(x)}{\\partial x}=\\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))$: \n$$\n-\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y^{(i)} \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)}-(1-y^{(i)} ) \\frac{1}{1-\\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)}\\right)\\\\\n     \\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)\\left(1-\\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)\\right)^{(*)} \\frac{\\partial[x^{(i)}\\beta]}{\\partial\\beta_j} \\\\\n=-\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y^{(i)}\\left(1-\\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)\\right)-(1-y^{(i)} ) \\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)\\right) x_j^{(i)} \\\\\n=-\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y^{(i)}-\\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)\\right) x_j^{(i)} \\\\\n=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\sigma\\left(x^{(i)}\\beta\\right)-y^{(i)}\\right) x_j^{(i)}.\n$$\n\nThe result sum can be then rewritten in a more convenient gradient matrix form as:\n$$\nX^T(\\sigma(X\\beta)-Y)\n$$\n\nThen we can finally use gradient descent in order to iteratively update our parameters:\n$$\n\\beta_{t+1}=\\beta_t - \\eta [X^T(\\sigma(X\\beta_t)-Y)]\n$$",
