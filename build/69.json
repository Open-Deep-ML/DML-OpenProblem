  "learn_section": "\n# Understanding R-squared (R²) in Regression Analysis\n\nR-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. It provides insight into how well the model fits the data.\n\n### Mathematical Definition\n\nThe R-squared value is calculated using the following formula:  \n$$\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SSR}}{\\text{SST}}\n$$\nWhere:  \n\n1) $ \\text{SSR} $ (Sum of Squared Residuals): The sum of the squares of the differences between the actual values and the predicted values.  \n2) $ \\text{SST} $ (Total Sum of Squares): The sum of the squares of the differences between the actual values and the mean of the actual values.\n\n### Equations for SSR and SST\n\nTo calculate SSR and SST, we use the following formulas:  \n\n1) SSR:  \n$$\n\\text{SSR} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n$$  \n\n2) SST:  \n$$\n\\text{SST} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\n$$  \n\nWhere:  \n\n1) $ y_i $: Actual value  \n2) $ \\hat{y}_i $: Predicted value  \n3) $ \\bar{y} $: Mean of the actual values  \n\n### Significance of R-squared\n\nR-squared is a key metric for evaluating how well a regression model performs. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit for the model, meaning it can explain more variability in the data. However, it's important to note:  \n\n- A high R-squared does not always imply that the model is good; it can sometimes be misleading if overfitting occurs.  \n- It should be used in conjunction with other metrics for comprehensive model evaluation.\n\n### Implementing R-squared Calculation\n\nIn this problem, you will implement a function to calculate R-squared given arrays of true and predicted values from a regression task. The results should be rounded to three decimal places.  \n\nIn the solution, the implemented $ r\\_squared() $ function calculates R-squared by first determining SSR and SST, then applying them to compute $ R^2 $. It handles edge cases such as perfect predictions and situations where all true values are identical.\n\n### Reference\n\nYou can refer to this resource for more information:  \n[Coefficient of Determination](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/statistics/regression-and-correlation/coefficient-of-determination-r-squared.html)",
