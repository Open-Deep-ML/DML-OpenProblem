  "description": "Write a Python function to calculate the probability of observing exactly k events in a fixed interval using the Poisson distribution formula. The function should take k (number of events) and lam (mean rate of occurrences) as inputs and return the probability rounded to 5 decimal places.",
  "learn_section": "## Understanding Poisson Distribution\n\nThe Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, provided these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.\n\n### Mathematical Definition\n\nThe probability of observing \\( k \\) events in a given interval is defined as:\n\n$$\nP(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n$$\n\n- **\\( k \\)**: Number of events (non-negative integer)\n- **\\( \\lambda \\)**: The mean number of events in the given interval (rate parameter)\n- **\\( e \\)**: Euler's number, approximately 2.718\n\n### Key Properties\n\n- **Mean**: \\( \\lambda \\)\n- **Variance**: \\( \\lambda \\)\n- The Poisson distribution is used for modeling rare or random events.\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nSuppose the mean number of calls received in an hour (\\( \\lambda \\)) is 5. Calculate the probability of receiving exactly 3 calls in an hour:\n\n1. **Substitute into the formula**:\n   $$\n   P(3; 5) = \\frac{5^3 e^{-5}}{3!}\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate step-by-step**:\n   $$\n   P(3; 5) = \\frac{125 \\cdot e^{-5}}{6} \\approx 0.14037\n   $$\n\n### Applications\n\nThe Poisson distribution is widely used in:\n\n- Modeling the number of arrivals at a queue (e.g., calls at a call center)\n- Counting occurrences over time (e.g., number of emails received per hour)\n- Biology (e.g., distribution of mutations in a DNA strand)\n- Traffic flow analysis (e.g., number of cars passing through an intersection)\n\nThis distribution is essential for understanding and predicting rare events in real-world scenarios.",
