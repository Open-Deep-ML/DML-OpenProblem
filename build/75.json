  "description": "\n## Task: Generate a Confusion Matrix\n\nYour task is to implement the function `confusion_matrix(data)` that generates a confusion matrix for a binary classification problem. The confusion matrix provides a summary of the prediction results on a classification problem, allowing you to visualize how many data points were correctly or incorrectly labeled.\n\n### Input:\n- A list of lists, where each inner list represents a pair \n- `[y_true, y_pred]` for one observation. `y_true` is the actual label, and `y_pred` is the predicted label.\n\n### Output:\n- A $2 \\times 2$ confusion matrix represented as a list of lists.",
  "learn_section": "\n## Generate Confusion Matrix\n\nThe confusion matrix is a very useful tool to get a better understanding of the performance of a classification model. In it, you can visualize how many data points were labeled according to their correct categories.\n\nFor a binary classification problem of a dataset with $ n $ observations, the confusion matrix is a $ 2 \\times 2 $ matrix with the following structure:\n\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} \nTP & FN \\\\\nFP & TN\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- **TP**: True positives, the number of observations from the positive label that were correctly labeled as positive.\n- **FN**: False negatives, the number of observations from the positive label that were incorrectly labeled as negative.\n- **FP**: False positives, the number of observations from the negative label that were incorrectly labeled as positive.\n- **TN**: True negatives, the number of observations from the negative label that were correctly labeled as negative.\n\nA confusion matrix is a great starting point for computing more advanced metrics such as precision and recall that capture the model's performance.",
