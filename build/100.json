  "learn_section": "## Understanding the Softsign Activation Function\n\nThe Softsign activation function is a smooth, non-linear activation function used in neural networks. It’s similar to the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function but with different properties, particularly in its tails which approach their limits more slowly.\n\n### Mathematical Definition\n\nThe Softsign function is mathematically defined as:\n\n$$\nSoftsign(x) = \\frac{x}{1 + |x|}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $x$ is the input to the function\n- $|x|$ represents the absolute value of $x$\n\n### Characteristics\n\n- **Output Range:** The output is bounded between -1 and 1, approaching these values asymptotically as $x$ approaches $\\pm \\infty$.\n- **Shape:** The function has an S-shaped curve, similar to tanh but with a smoother approach to its asymptotes.\n- **Gradient:** The gradient is smoother and more gradual compared to tanh, which can help prevent vanishing gradient problems in deep networks.\n- **Symmetry:** The function is symmetric around the origin $(0,0)$.\n\n### Key Properties\n\n- **Bounded Output:** Unlike ReLU, Softsign naturally bounds its output between -1 and 1.\n- **Smoothness:** The function is continuous and differentiable everywhere.\n- **No Saturation:** The gradients approach zero more slowly than in tanh or sigmoid functions.\n- **Zero-Centered:** The function crosses through the origin, making it naturally zero-centered.\n\nThis activation function can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need bounded outputs with more gradual saturation compared to tanh or sigmoid functions.",
