  "description": "Write a Python function to determine whether a machine learning model is overfitting, underfitting, or performing well based on training and test accuracy values. The function should take two inputs: `training_accuracy` and `test_accuracy`. It should return one of three values: 1 if Overfitting, -1 if Underfitting, or 0 if a Good fit. The rules for determination are as follows: \n- **Overfitting**: The training accuracy is significantly higher than the test accuracy (difference > 0.2).\n- **Underfitting**: Both training and test accuracy are below 0.7.\n- **Good fit**: Neither of the above conditions is true.",
  "learn_section": "## Understanding Overfitting and Underfitting\n\nOverfitting and underfitting are two common problems in machine learning models that affect their performance and generalization ability.\n\n### Overfitting\nOverfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns. This results in high training accuracy but poor performance on unseen data (low test accuracy).\n\n- **Indicators**: Training accuracy >> Test accuracy (large gap).\n\n### Underfitting\nUnderfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This leads to poor performance on both training and test datasets.\n\n- **Indicators**: Both training and test accuracy are low.\n\n### Good Fit\nA good fit occurs when the model generalizes well to unseen data, with training and test accuracy being close and both reasonably high.\n\n### Remedies\n- **For Overfitting**:\n  - Use regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2 regularization).\n  - Reduce model complexity by pruning unnecessary features.\n  - Add more training data to improve generalization.\n- **For Underfitting**:\n  - Increase model complexity (e.g., add layers or features).\n  - Train the model for more epochs.\n  - Enhance feature engineering or input data quality.\n\n### Mathematical Representation\n1. Overfitting:\n   $$ \\text{Training Accuracy} - \\text{Test Accuracy} > 0.2 $$\n\n2. Underfitting:\n   $$ \\text{Training Accuracy} < 0.7 \\, \\text{and} \\, \\text{Test Accuracy} < 0.7 $$\n\n3. Good Fit:\n   $$ \\text{Neither overfitting nor underfitting is true.} $$",
