  "description": "Captain Redbeard, the most daring pirate of the seven seas, has uncovered a mysterious ancient map. Instead of islands, it shows a strange wavy curve, and the treasure lies at the lowest point of the land! (watch out for those tricky local mins)\n\nThe land's height at any point $x$ is given by:\n\nf(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2\n\n\n**Your Mission:**\nImplement a Python function that finds the value of $x$ where $f(x)$ reaches its minimum, starting from any random initial position.",
  "learn_section": "## How to Find the Minimum of a Function\n\nTo find the minimum of a function like\n\n$$\nf(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2\n$$\n\nwe can use a technique called **gradient descent**.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Find the Derivative**\n   - The derivative (slope) tells us which direction the function is increasing or decreasing.\n   - For this problem, the derivative is:\n     $$\n     f'(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2\n     $$\n\n2. **Move Opposite the Slope**\n   - If the slope is positive, move left.\n   - If the slope is negative, move right.\n   - Update the position by:\n     $$\n     x_{new} = x_{old} - \\text{learning rate} \\times f'(x_{old})\n     $$\n\n3. **Repeat**\n   - Keep updating $x$ until the change is very small (below a tolerance).\n\n### Why Does This Work?\n- If you always move downhill along the slope, you eventually reach a bottom a local minimum.\n\n### Important Terms\n- **Learning Rate**: How big a step to take each update.\n- **Tolerance**: How close successive steps must be to stop.\n- **Local Minimum**: A point where the function value is lower than nearby points.\n\nIn this problem, Captain Redbeard finds the hidden treasure by moving downhill until he reaches the lowest point!",
