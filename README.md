# DML-OpenProblem

DML-OpenProblem is an open-source repository of problems focused on linear algebra, machine learning, and deep learning. The problems are designed to be solved from scratch, providing a robust learning experience. This project powers the website [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/).

## Installation

To get started with DML-OpenProblem, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DML-OpenProblem.git
cd DML-OpenProblem
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting up Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality. The hooks automatically format Python files in the `Problems` directory, ensuring consistent whitespace (converting tabs to spaces) and line endings.

1. Install pre-commit:
```sh
pip install pre-commit
```

2. Install the git hooks:
```sh
pre-commit install
```

Now, whenever you make a commit, the pre-commit hooks will automatically run and fix any whitespace issues in Python files. If any files are modified by the hooks, you'll need to stage those changes and commit again.

## Usage
You can use the repository to create, edit, and solve problems related to linear algebra, machine learning, and deep learning. The problems are structured in directories, each containing relevant files such as learn.html for the learning section and solution.py for the solution code.

### Running the Streamlit App

To launch the Streamlit application for editing and viewing problems, use the following command:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Features
- Problem Editor: Edit the learn.html and solution.py files for each problem using a web-based code editor.
- Preview Section: Preview the learning section with LaTeX rendering for mathematical expressions.
- Save Changes: Save your edits to the corresponding files in the repository.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve DML-OpenProblem and [deep-ml.com](https://www.deep-ml.com). If you have a new problem to add or improvements to existing problems, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. All contributions will be displayed on [deep-ml.com](https://www.deep-ml.com). For example, check out this problem: [Divide Dataset Based on Feature Threshold](https://www.deep-ml.com/problem/Divide%20Dataset%20Based%20on%20Feature%20Threshold). A helpfull tool to work on the learn section and know what it would look like on the front end is [https://openproblem-r4vsjwuthdl9a3qzrd4p3m.streamlit.app/](https://dml-openproblem-a5bwuwjh2xeyt5ta5wdiw9.streamlit.app/). Also here is an example of a learn section writing in markdown [Example Problem](https://github.com/Open-Deep-ML/DML-OpenProblem/tree/main/example_problem)


### Steps to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear and concise messages.
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

### Steps to add a Problem
1. create an issue, the issue should describe the problem you would like to create and use the label "New Problem"
2. comment below the issue you would like to work on
3. We will assign the issue and let you know what number problem to make it

### How to Add a Video Solution (Optional)

1. **Create a Comprehensive Video Solution**:  
   Your video should clearly explain the concept and provide a step-by-step solution to the problem. Feel free to include additional elements that enhance understanding, such as animations, hand-written examples, or any other visual aids that will help clarify the topic.

2. **Upload the Video to YouTube**:  
   Once your video is ready, upload it to YouTube. Make sure the video is accessible and properly titled.

3. **Include a Link to the Problem**:  
   In the video description, add a link to the corresponding problem on Deep-ML so that viewers can easily access and try solving the problem themselves.
   
5. **Submit the Video Link**:  
In the corresponding problem folder, create a `.txt` file containing the link to your YouTube video. This will help us easily reference your solution.

## How to Add an Interactive Learn for a Problem (Optional)

1. **Create a Problem Folder**: Navigate to the `Problems/interactive_learn/` directory and create a folder named `problem-N`, where `N` is the problem number assigned to you (e.g., `problem-17`).

2. **Add Learning Materials**: Inside the folder, create a `notebook.py` file. This file should include the learning content with explanations, examples, and any required resources for the problem. You could use https://marimo.app/?slug=aojjhb to ensure the file is compatible with `marimo` for HTML-WASM conversion. For example, you can check [problem-4's notebook.py](Problems/interactive_learn/problem-4/notebook.py)

3. **Submit Changes**: Commit the new folder with its contents to your branch and submit a pull request. Ensure your commit messages clearly indicate the addition of the interactive learn for the problem.

4. **Collaborate for Review**: Engage with reviewers for feedback on your pull request. Make any necessary adjustments as suggested.
## How to Add C++ Questions

We are adding C++ support to the problem set, and you can contribute C++ solutions following these guidelines.

### Steps to Add a C++ Solution

1. **Select a problem** from the existing Python-based problems.
2. **Create a C++ solution file** inside the corresponding problem folder, naming it `solution.cpp`.
3. **Follow the C++ coding guidelines**:
   - Use **C++17 or later**.
   - Prefer **Eigen** for matrix operations (or xtensor-blas if necessary).
   - Ensure **well-structured, readable, and modular code**.
   - Keep solutions **self-contained** and avoid unnecessary external dependencies.
   - Format numerical outputs to **4 decimal places** for consistency.
4. **Test your solution** to ensure correctness.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a detailed explanation of your solution.

### C++ Coding Rules

- Use **Eigen** for matrix computations where applicable.
- Avoid **excessive STL usage** unless necessary for clarity.
- Prefer **pass-by-reference** over pass-by-value to improve performance.
- Ensure **error handling** without crashing the program.
- Keep solutions **deterministic** and **efficient**.

If you have any questions about library choices or implementation details, feel free to start a discussion in the GitHub issues section.
